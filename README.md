## INFORMATION

This module enables the native call recording feature on OxygenOS (and ROMs based on it).
This is achieved by simply changing a hidden secure setting on OxygenOS (and ROMs based on it), at every boot, since the setting is reset everytime the phone is restarted.
If you wish to see what commands are being run by the script, check out the "service.sh" file present in the "common" folder of this module.
For more information/support, you can reach out to me at xda-developers on the address below.
Enjoy the module!
